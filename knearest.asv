%---------------------K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm------------------------

% 1- Choose the number of k neighbours.

% 2- Compute the k neighbors of the new data point according to some
% distance measure such as Euclidean.

% 3- Count the number of data points from each category among the
% neighbours computed in step 2.

% 4- The new datapoint is assigned to the category whit most neighbours.
